                    <p>
                        I have been interested in security for a long time ago, I found this branch of computer science interesting because it helps prevents crimes and protect others from possible dangers.
                        In this career, I think it is important to combine the role of protection and security with the understanding of the digital enviroment to help others in real life aspects.
