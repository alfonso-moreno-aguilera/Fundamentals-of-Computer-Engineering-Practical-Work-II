# Fundamentals-of-Computer-Engineering-Practical-Work-II
## Description of the practical work
In this work, I will do a website that includes seven different html files conected between them, applying all the knowledge of HTML and CSS I have. It will have a index file, that will be the "Home" where you will start, an about file with a presentation, images and a CV, a contact file with a friendly contact form, the degree file, with all the subjects of my degree and a link to the fce file which contains information in-depth about this subject, and the net file with links to other friends pages and a topic file that will have information about something of my interest.

## Actions
- Added a folder called *docs* inside de root folder.

- Added inside the folder *docs* three more folders called *CSS*, *images* and *public* and a html file called index.

- Added inside of the folder *public* five more html files called: *about*, *contact*, *net*, *degree* and *topic*.

- I added the basic code with a header, a main and a footer in the index file.

- Added all subjects of the degree into de html file "degree", I need to add an few explanation for each one. Also added the html file that will contain all the information about the subject "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering".

- Finished adding information to the degree file and added pictures and almost finished the about file.

- Started at 17:00 and finished adding information at 21:37 of the fce file, including the tables of the blocks and units.

- Started adding CSS to the website (Style to the contact file).

- I deleted almost everything of the degree file and made it again, I also gave some styles to some files and finished the topic and the net page.
## Problems during the development
- First problem was thinking about the structure I wanted to give to my website, the practical work give us a structure to follow, but I my problem was how to start writing the code, the style I wanted to give and the information I was going to put. Also I revised the theory.

- I started the CSS but I saw I needed to structure better some parts of the html files because I started mixing things, I tried fixing it. 

- I had to almost start from the beggining the degree file because I forgot about the category, so I erased almost everythings and done a table with the subjects and the category
## Conclusion
This project help me to apply all my knowledge of this course into practice letting us gain practical experience in this type of tools, the project let space to be creative and helped having a better understanding about HTML and CSS, helping me to create a functional well-structured website.
